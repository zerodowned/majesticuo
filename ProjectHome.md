A UO Client written in C#. The idea was taken from a text based client created by Mikel Duke.

The aim of this project is to create a completely functional text based uo client in C#, Allowing for advanced macros/scripts to be ran.
Being purely text based will mean the possibility of running 100's of clients from the one machine.

Inspiration is taken from UOAI, Stealth, UO Machine, Easyuo etc.

For basic usage no UO files are needed.

Some Basic features supported are as follows:

Clioc Support via ultima.dll all clioc messages are displayed.
Skills/Spells/Targeting/Finditem/Movement/basic variables are all done.
Some refinement is needed in some of these areas.

[R46](https://code.google.com/p/majesticuo/source/detail?r=46) Adds login encryption support and prelim game encryption support.
